# TreeCity
# Team TreeCity

**Propose:** Who takes care of the trees of our planets? Legally we may not be responsible for them in most cases, but we can do more, because they are responsible for us. We are a team with the purpose of uniting three spheres present in our community, with a common mission: to save the trees of our planet.

**Develop:** (System + Landing Page) designed and prepared to be developed in Python using a Framework (Django) with direct deploy in Heroku.

We are from :heart: *MaringÃ¡*

# How To

Create a *.env* archive
```python
SECRET_KEY=
DEBUG =
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=
```

# Next Step

**The system is still not functional, only the development and deploy environment was created and model. And an initial database model with some modifications within DjangoAdmin were performed.**
